# QuickStart Demo

This project implements the simplest non-trivial example how you can implement [CRUD ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) functionality on top of ESENT Serialization library.

The project is completely stand-alone: it uses the library from the NuGet package, like you’ll probably be doing.

As a bonus, it also demonstrates how to use the tuple index to perform a full-text search over a column in the database.
